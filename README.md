###  [Check out the live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/to-do-list/)! :smile:

## Description:
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).<br>
It allows the user to keep track of the tasks they need to do and sort them into different projects.<br>
The main purpose of this project was to get more practice with Object Oriented Programming and also to get familiar with the SOLID principles in practice.

## How it looks:

## New things learned:
- SOLID principles in theory and practice.
- What localStorage is and how to use it.
- How dates work in JavaScript and how useful date libraries like date-fns can be.

## Thoughts on the project:
I liked this project a lot. It allowed me to better understand a lot of concepts I had previously seen but hadn't fully grasped.<br>
Admittedly, I'm not sure whether or not I managed to write 100% SOLID code this time, but it was a really fun project nonetheless.<br>
I'm sure I'll soon look back at this project and realize everything I could have done better; that's the beauty of learning and github :)
